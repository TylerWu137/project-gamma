                    <p>In 2047, a nuclear world war was set off. Nuclear missiles were launched worldwide, killing billions of 
                    people, wildlife, and the environment, creating unlivable conditions. Suspecting a nuclear war, some 
                    countries devised contingency plans to escape Earth and survive in space stations until conditions on Earth
                    were safe enough to return.</p>

                    <p>It has been 100 years since the nuclear war, and we believe it may be safe to return. We have chosen to 
                    send you back to Earth. Your task is to determine whether it is safe for the rest of us to return as well. 
                    Here is a device for you to register environmental conditions and potential wildlife that has survived, 
                    and communicate with us. Your dog, Gamma, will also accompany you, as well as a high-speed hover-bike, 
                    food rations, and other equipment.</p>
