                        though highly unlikely. You visit your great grandparents' house, the high school, popular social 
                        settings like the local Starbucks, bowling alley, and ramen place all in ruins, but you unfortunately 
                        don't find anyone, as you predicted.</p>

                    <p>You continue your search, when you spot a building that seems to be intact — the only one in the entire 
                        town. You enter the building and find spots of recent activity, such as a couple fires and cans of 
                        food left open. Since you've had bad experiences with survivors in the past, you eat a blue apple you packed from
                        yesterday to boost your stats in preparation.</p>
                    <p>You investigate the building further and find an elderly human with what looks like a mutated dog!</p>
