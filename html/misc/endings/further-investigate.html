                <p>As a result from the encounters you've had over the past two days, you decide Earth needs further 
                    investigating. You report back to Space Station HQ about your findings and need to stay on Earth
                    longer.
                </p>
                <p>And so, you spend the next couple of months discovering all new kinds of mutated creatures and plant
                    life, as well as how to tame creatures and have them fight alongside you, travelling across this new
                    world with your buddy Gamma.
