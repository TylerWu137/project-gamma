                <p>As a result from the encounters you've had over the past two days, you decide Earth is too dangerous
                    to continue investigating, so you report to Space Station HQ and they decide you should be sent back
                    up.
                </p>
                <p>You travel back to Stony Brook, where your space pod landed, and fly back up to the space station
                    with Gamma. It appears we must wait longer before we can all travel back to Earth.
